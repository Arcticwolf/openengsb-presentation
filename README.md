openengsb-presentation
======================

This project's purpose is the first half of the thesis validation code of Felix Mayerhuber, containing test code for the model transformation unit of the OpenEngSB project. It contains all transformation definitions + the logic for the thesis validation elements.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
This bundle has been reimplemented to fit the standard domain/connector format of the OpenEngSB project. The new implementation of this bundle is now a domain bundle and is located under the link: https://github.com/Arcticwolf/openengsb-connector-presentation (there is also the usage guide located). The big advantage of this new implementation is: You are not required to change something in the code to call different validation elements. Instead you can call the validation elements via the OpenEngSB TestClient. The corresponding domain is located under the link: https://github.com/Arcticwolf/openengsb-domain-presentation.
